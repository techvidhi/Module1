# Module 1 Challenge

## Overview and Origin

Stripe is a fintech company founded in 2010 by John and Patrick Collison. Both brothers were both young scholars at the time of Stripe's idea. Patrick was working on many projects including his other company Auctomatic and realized how difficult it was to transact money online, mainly accepting payments for their services on the web. Collison brothers wanted to solve this problem of accepting online payments, they wanted to come up with a solution which would make the process extremely simple. First funding for Stripe Inc. came from Y Combinator, the ceo of the company, Paul Graham worked with Patrick in Auctomatic and offered to fund. YC invested $20-30K. They even met PayPal's co-founder Peter Thiel to get some insights on what challenges PayPal faced due to compliance and international payment issues. Later on Peter Thiel including other investors from Silicon Valley invested in Stripe. Stripe's has raised $2.3B in investment funds over the years. 

## Business Activities

Stripe is trying to solve the problems merchants face while accepting online payments such as fraud, chargebacks, international payments, system integration and compliance in a user-friendly manner. Stripe’s intended customers are merchants/businesses who want to accept payments online from their customers. Correct information about Stripe’s market size is unavailable because it’s a private company but major businesses like Amazon, Apple, Walmart use Stripe as their payment partner.

Stripe offers online payment solutions which are very customer friendly. Similar companies like PayPal and Square try to provide services but PayPal is known to have struggles with the regulations and compliance, time delays while Square is more focused on hardware payment solutions for brick and motor stores.

According to Crunchbase and Stack,  Stripe uses around 66 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery. According to BuiltWith, Stripe is actively using 55 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, iPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Apple Mobile Web Clips Icon.

## Landscape

Stripe is in the digital payments domain of the FinTech industry. There are many innovations over the years in this domain. Some of the trends in this domain are;

* Cryptocurrency has gone mainstream and many researchers have claimed that 2022-2023 are the years where we see a rise in the cryptocurrency market.
* Using Software as a Service (SaaS) has increased and alongwith it use of Regulation as a Service (RaaS) has increased too. 
* Buy now and pay later is a very big trend currently. Companies like Afterpay and PayBright are becoming more and more household names due to their 0% lending credit on consumer goods.
* Everyone is using Payment Tap technology nowadays which has reduced a lot of friction in payments. Phone companies like Apple and Samsung have made it easier for us to carry our wallets in our phones.
* Although there are not many Super Apps in the North America right now, there is a rise in the usage of it globally. Super App is a mobile/web application which provides multiple services like social media communications and financial transactions as well. The rise of these apps is a new trend in this domain.

Major companies in the domain are PayPal, Square, Venmo, Amazon Pay etc.

## Results

So far the company has disrupted the domain through its extremely customer friendly website and thats why it has made it easier for businesses to accept credit card payments online globally. Which has been difficult to achieve by the companies in the same domain.

The core metrics from which we can know stripe's business performance is through the subscription rates, how many businesses are signing up for it, the number of transactions on the platform and the fees collected from the transactions. Stripe does not release its financial data so its difficult to determine the actual metrics of the performance.

Stripe is performing well considering that its a privately held company. Stripe does not release the financial data but we can find it through the CB Insights and Wall Street reports. According to the Wall Street, Stripe registered $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020.  While PayPal's revenue is 25.37 Billion reported on Decemeber 31 2021. 

## Recommendations

According to me, Stripe is doing well but they should also invest in some hardware for businesses like their competitor Square because it will increase their market and not every company is accepting online payments, many are still brick and motor stores.It will increase their target market and revenues eventually. Hardware POS will be the additional technology required for this service.
